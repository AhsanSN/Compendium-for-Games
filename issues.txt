issues (will be opened on github)

issue 1:

Create a function inside "js/renderer.js" can takes a folder name as input, and returns the static path (C:/...) of the the .exe file present in it. You are told that the folder will always contain one and only one .exe file.

issue 2:

Edit the <code>viewgames.css</code> and <code>viewgames.html</code> such that the viewgames.html is divided into two vertical parts. One contains the list of games as in the present code, and the other will have space for 1 screenshot of the game.

issue 3:

(linked to issue 2)

Create a function in <code>renderer.js</code> that takes as input the path of an image file and shows it as the screenshot of the present game.

issue 4:

Edit the database.js such that now GamesDB.txt stores 4 values instead of 3. The new stored value (4th line in database)should be an image path. Make new functions if required.

issue 5

Edit <code>uploadgame.html</code> and <code>uploadgame.js</code> and add an option of uploading 1 screenshot image of the image. This image path should then be added to the database. 

issue 6:

Add another screen "gameRunning.html" that should run once an exe has started running. It should contain a return option that sends the user to "viewGames.html"

issue 7:

Edit the "js/renderer.js", such that when a game is selected, the path of the selected game should not be dynamically made, but should be selected from "GamesDB.txt". Make necessary functions in <code>database.js</code>

issue 8:

Create necessay file and functions that are run when the software is run. The file will check if there is a software's shortcut on the user's desktop. If not, it will create the exe's shortcut.

issue 9:

Use "electron-db" as the software's database instead of <code>GamesDB.txt</code>. Replace all the present functions. Create a new file <code>e-Database.js</code> and dont edit the current <code>database.js</code>.

Rough: <code></code>

Best of luck.
