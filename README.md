# Compendium-for-Games
A SEGA type compendium where people can play game of their choice. The compendium contains many games and contains the feature to add new games - locally as well as globally to the server. It can also download new games from our cloud. The uploading of a game to the cloud through the software is managed by us to prevent uploading of infectious executable files.

Built on NodeJS using Electron.
